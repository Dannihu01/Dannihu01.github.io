Guest Lecture in EECS 481 - Software Engineering. In this talk, I explored the unique challenges and opportunities faced by transfer students in higher education. Drawing from personal experience, we discussed practical strategies for adjusting to a new academic environment, building a strong support network, and taking advantage of resources that can help students succeed. The talk also covered how to navigate the competitive world of internshipsâ€”offering insights into finding opportunities, preparing for interviews, and leveraging internships to boost career prospects while still in school. This session provided actionable advice aimed at helping other students thrive both academically and professionally.
